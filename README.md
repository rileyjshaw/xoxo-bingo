xoxo bingo
==========

## timeline
2019: i've been too cheap to get https://xoxo.bingo in previous years, but
[andy](https://twitter.com/andymcmillan) noticed a thread on slack and hooked
us up! thx andy.

2018: xoxo was in the midst of changing their infrastructure, so i lost access
to the attendee directory. [hannah](https://twitter.com/herlifeinpixels),
[jason](https://twitter.com/justsomeguy) and i met in a cafe before the kickoff
ceremony and designed a static version with input from the community. hannah
and jason made 25 icons in like two minutes, it was incredible!!!

2017: no xoxo, no bingoâ€¦ missed u all

2016: we made the cards prettier by pulling in peopleâ€™s twitter photos and
doing imgmagick to them ðŸ”®

2015: first bingo! [eli](https://twitter.com/veryeli) and i used the attendee
directory to generate a unique card for everyone (twitter login kept it private
ðŸ”’). squares on your card were other attendees - if you met someone on your
card you got to check it off. we made it cuz weâ€™re shy. most of it is in the
`pre-2019` folder!

## code
each year pre-2019, this was coded on day 1 of the festival, a few hours before
kickoff. plz lower your expectations before reading the source ðŸ”¥

in 2019 i'm a big grownup so i'm starting in august.

check the git history and the `pre-2019` folder for how the old site worked.
`2019-and-on` is where it's at now!
